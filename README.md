The March 2023 floods in Malawi have highlighted the urgent need to take action on climate change. These floods have caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods in the affected communities, leading to the loss of lives and displacement of families. The impacts of climate change, including more frequent and intense weather events like these floods, are felt disproportionately by vulnerable communities in Malawi and around the world.

The floods in Malawi serve as a reminder of the urgent need for action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. In my local community, we can take steps to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate-related risks, such as by investing in flood protection measures, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and adopting renewable energy sources. At the same time, it is essential that we work together globally to address the root causes of climate change, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.

As an individual, I am committed to taking action on climate change and contributing to solutions that mitigate its effects. I believe that participating in Moja Global's mission to develop open-source software that supports ambitious climate action is an excellent opportunity to make a meaningful contribution towards these efforts. By leveraging the power of technology and collaboration, we can create innovative solutions that help communities adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to a more sustainable future.
